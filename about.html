                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p>I began my journey in game design at a community college at 17 years old, but that has led me to explore even more types of technology. 
                        I transferred to RIT in the fall of 2023 to major in networking for one year before I realized my passion was in the field of software engineering.
                        I discovered this passion through my time in an academic organization called the Society of Software Engineers, where I quickly became a member then joined the officers as the head of Student Outreach. 
                        Assisting with Open House events for the Software Engineering department and website rebuild development team. Iâ€™m now wrapping up my second year in the software engineering curriculum here at RIT and 
                        I am looking for my first co-op with a software company to gain valuable experience and bring my unique skill set to the team.</p>
